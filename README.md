# Homework research project

One of the objectives of the homework research project is to study a little bit in depth a subject that draws your attention and interest related to Cloud Computing and Big Data Analytics. It is a common practice in computer science where professionals are regularly challenged to **increase their knowledge on new topics that they might need to use for their daily work**. 

During the research, you need to be able *to find reliable and trustworthy sources of information*, understand them and try to invest as much or as little time as necessary to decide whether you are going to spend more time learning about the question.

Another of the objectives of this homework assignment is to **cooperate and share your knowledge** with your peers and help each other to be able to have a broader understanding of Cloud Computing and Big Data Analytics. Therefore, to focus your research, I would like you to think about the information that you will be sharing from your classmates perspective *(use the following ideas to center your research focus not like the report index)*: 
- What would you like to know about the presented topic to be able to decide if it is worth going in depth or just stop and take a different approach?
- What do people say regarding the subject you are studying: is it very successful? Is it mature enough? Do many people praise or criticize it?
- What has been your personal experience regarding the subject? What lessons have you learned?
- Share some relevant sources of information to learn more about the topic (URLs of websites, Articles, Blogs, PDF files, online courses, etc.)

A final objective of the presentation is to be able to **share the information attractively and concisely**. You can't expect your audience to invest lots of time on a topic that may not be of their interest. Therefore I encourage you to deliver a short, meaningful and attractive presentation together with a report that will be read by those who want to go deeper on your research topic. It is also a good practice for you to be able to complement your presentation with a Q&A turn to offer information on details that haven't been explained precisely enough, at least for some people in the audience.

## The presentation

Maybe you have attended the Barcelona Data beers event (http://databeersbcn.com/). They use a fun Japanese Presentation Technique that is called Pecha Kutcha (http://www.pechakucha.org/faq). In that technique, you need to make an effort to communicate your idea, synthesizing as much as possible, because you only have **six minutes** to do it.

The elevator pitch is a different technique that also encourages the speaker to focus on delivering only the most relevant information. The goal is to communicate the idea excitingly. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elevator_pitch)

The speaker typically needs to explain:
- who the product/idea is for, 
- what it does, 
- why it is demanded, 
- how it will get done. 

An elevator pitch does not have to contain all of those components, but it usually does at least explain why the idea is valuable and what the idea is. 

I challenge you **to make the effort of extracting the best of the best of your homework project** and be able to inspire on the Pecha Kutcha technique to deliver your presentations.

You can watch many [Pechakucha presentations for the BCN DataBeers event](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCGhaRXo3qMJHMFH62wCB0Gg/videos) for some inspiration.

Therefore, for the homework research presentation, the format will be twenty slides and twenty seconds per slide for your presentation (a total of six minutes) and three more minutes for Q&A. The slides will be passed manually, but it is better that you adjust your presentation, as much as possible, to the timings. *After six minutes you will need to stop the delivery and begin the Q&A turn.*

The delivery of your topic will be scheduled on a slot every 10 minutes. A calendar of the presentation days and teams order will be made public at Racó.

Both team members need to demonstrate they have equally prepared their selected topic. The quality of the delivery and the answers will be taken into account. Therefore **both members may not end up having the same grade**. 

There are two ways of delivering the presentation:

a) present the slides both members simultaneously (10 slides each: *a-a-...-a-b-b-...-b* or *a-b-a-b-...-a-b* or any other mix you find more suitable to your topic). Questions can be answered by the one who knows more about the matter that the audience is asking about. 

b) one delivers the 20 slides, and the other one responds the Q&A, bearing in mind that **who will be doing what will be decided just before the presentation begins by each team member selecting a piece of paper saying "presentation"/"Q&A"**.

## The report

Given the fact that you all are helping your classmates increasing their knowledge on Cloud Computing and Big Data Analytics the report will be written using markup with embedded images, URLs, videos or whatever information you consider interesting to share. That will offer a shared look and feel to the final result.

The written report length needs to have a minimum of 3000 English words and a maximum of 5000 English words (that is, approximately, between six and ten pages of text, not including images, videos, and other resources).

The report will be graded based on the **quality of the explanations**: 
- Structure your text in several sections each with introduction, body, and conclusion.
- Try to offer clear ideas and give useful and meaningful examples and resources to complement the concepts exposed.
- Be concise and respectful of the time that the reader is investing: if you can explain something using three sentences do not write six phrases just for the sake of making your text appear longer.

Each team needs to prepare a folder with, at least, one README.md file that contains the written information you consider necessary to share the knowledge you have acquired. Add the images or other complementary files to that folder. All the included files **must be linked** to the text of the README.md file.

If you are the same team for this assignment and for the laboratory sessions you only need **to create a new folder named Research-topic** at the Lab-solutions repo. If you have a different partner, create a **new private GitHub** git repository with the name **Research-topic** add your partner and *angeltoribio-UPC-BCN*. All the presentation contents will be copied and added to **this repository** where anybody will be able to read your report.

# Submit your assignment

You need to create a **PDF** file with the 20 slides and submit it to the Racó together with the name of the authors and the GitHub URL containing your report.
